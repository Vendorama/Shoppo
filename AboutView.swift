Shoppo is discovery shopping platform for New Zealand retailers to showcase, promote and sell their products. Shoppo makes it easier for kiwis to **shop local** for over 2 million products from over 12 thousand online stores from around New Zealand.

Businesses with an online store can list their products so customers can click through to their website to purchase. Shoppo scans websites in New Zealand looking for products to list, and provided the criteria are met displays them along with company name and any contact details if available.
